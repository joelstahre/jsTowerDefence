Live Demo : [JS TowerDefence](http://showcase.joelstahre.com/jstowerdefence/)

It’s strongly recommended to use latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser for the best viewer experience.

##Project Description
JS TowerDefence is my first application that I have written from scratch.
It’s a game that I developed for the Course “Individual Software Development” at Linnaeus University.

The course was the last for this semester and was 10 weeks long. I’ve been using the techniques we have learned during the year and also learned a lot of new things.

JS TowerDefence is, as you might have already guessed, a tower defense game.
Your task is to prevent the evil critters to escape, by placing towers which can shoot them down.

The application is written in pure javascript, html5 and css.
I know that many things can be done in better ways, but remember that this is my first application I’ve ever made =). The game is still not as playable as it should be. There is much left to do, but I hope I will have time to continue working on it in the future.

 

##Technology Involved
Javascript, HTML5, CSS. The game uses HTML5 canvas to draw the graphics to the screen.

 

##Questions, thoughts, Bug Reports and Feedback
I would love to get input, constructive feedback and help improving it.
